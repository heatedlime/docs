## How to Vote on Helium Vote

Helium uses Helium Vote to organize and manage governance,
vote escrowed tokens, delegation, and more. Using the links below, or your Helium Wallet app, you can cast your vote for the
subDAO of which you seek to impact and contribute to.

Ensure that you have a Solana-ready wallet that is funded with some SOL and one of the network
tokes: HNT, IOT, or MOBILE.

The second way to sign into Helium Vote is through web browser. Use your account that holds your veHNT 
positions to sign in to Helium Vote. The same account can be used for all platforms, but it must have 
veTokens for the specific DAO or subDAO hosting the vote.

### Casting Your Vote

After you have reviewed the proposal, casting your vote is as easy as issuing a Solana transaction
for "Yes" or "No".

Note: You will need a bit of Sol to cast your veTokens for a vote.

### Understanding Vote Power

When you vote your veTokens, all positions will be attributed to your vote choice. Token positions
cannot be split within one vote on a single account.

Your vote is calculated at the time your vote is submitted. If your position is in 'decay' mode,
voting sooner means you apply greater voting power.
