# CBRS Small Cell Radios

Instead of a LoRa antenna, Helium 5G Hotspots use Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) Radios to
provide cellular coverage. CBRS is a wide broadcast 3.5 GHz band in the United States that does not
require a 5G Hotspot Host to acquire spectrum licenses.

You can find more information about CBRS on the
[Federal Communications Commission Website](https://www.fcc.gov/35-ghz-band-overview).

5G Hotspots can provide 5G cellular coverage when connected to Indoor or Outdoor CBRS Small Cell
Radios while also providing LoRaWAN coverage.

:::warning

Only certified CBRS Radios provisioned with the FreedomFi firmware will operate when connected to a
5G Hotspot.

CBRS Radios that are not certified and do not use the FreedomFi firmware will not provide 5G
coverage and will not earn MOBILE.

The [Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium) is the best place to get real-time support from the
community. The [#5g-cbrs](discord://discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/836735476659912754)
channel is most relevant for using 5G on the Network.

## Installation and Setup Guides

Instructions on installing a CBRS Small Cell Radio and registration with the SAS are provided by the
individual 5G Hotspot Makers.

For FreedomFi Gateways, refer to the installation guides here:

- [FreedomFi Indoor Install Guide](https://freedomfi.com/freedomfi-indoor-cbrs-small-cell-setup-guide/)
- [FreedomFi Outdoor Install Guide](https://freedomfi.com/freedomfi-outdoor-cbrs-small-cell-setup-guide/)

For Bobcat500 Gateways, refer to the Bobcat Knowledge Center:

- [Bobcat Knowledge Center CBRS Radio Troubleshooting Guide](https://bobcatminer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4588536001435-Overview)

:::warning

Misrepresentation of CBRS Radio installation information, including GPS location, height, antenna
orientation, or other characteristics in a SAS, violates FCC regulations and may result in fines and
possible criminal penalties.

## Access Gateway and Radio Dashboards

Once the 5G Hotspot is onboarded and a Small Cell Radio installation is complete, the Small Cell
Radio will automatically initialize and acquire a GPS lock. Once that is complete, the Small Cell
Radio dashboard appears under the "Radio Dashboard" tab on the local IP address of the 5G Hotspot.

- You can access your 5G Hotspot Dashboard via the URL:
  https://hotspots.hellohelium.com/auth/login/methods/helium-wallet

5G Hotspot will appear on [explorer.helium.com](https://explorer.helium.com/) within five days,
depending on how quickly it is registered in the SAS.

## Outdoor Small Cell Radios

Outdoor Small Cell Radios are weatherized to endure the elements and are more powerful than Indoor
Small Cell Radios. However, Outdoor Small Cell Radios create a larger area of 5G coverage while
requiring more planning when installing and maintaining.

Outdoor Small Cell Radios require installation above ground level and require registration with the
Spectrum Access System (SAS) to operate. In order to start receiving rewards, your Radio must be 
registered with SAS by completing the CPI form within your [Radio Dashboard]( https://hotspots.hellohelium.com/auth/login/methods/helium-wallet). Please evaluate your site 
location and ability to install these Small Cell Radios, and consider hiring a professional to ensure 
your installation is secure and meets all regulatory requirements.

## Indoor Small Cell Radios

Indoor Small Cell Radios are less powerful and are ideal for installations such as coffee shops,
bars, grocery stores, etc. Indoor Small Cell Radios are generally easier to install and create a
smaller, localized area of 5G coverage. Indoor Small Cell Radios must be installed in a location in
which it can receive a signal, or else it will not broadcast a signal.

Indoor Small Cell Radios are physically smaller radios and can be installed at any height.
**Installing an Indoor Small Cell Radio outdoors is not recommended as they are not weather
resistant.**

## Using Multiple Small Cell Radios

A single 5G Hotspot can support multiple Small Cell Radios but requires an additional network
switch. A soft limit to consider is 7 Small Cell Radios to one 5G Hotspot; however, this limit is
only theoretical as the real limiting factor is bandwidth saturation. All 5G Hotspots are built with
a 1 Gbps Network Interface Card (NIC); the throughput of all the radios combined is limited to 1
Gbps or your internet speed, whichever is lower.

## Troubleshooting

### Confirm the Network is Working

Confirm your Radio's status within the [remote dashboard](https://hotspots.hellohelium.com/auth/login/methods/helium-wallet).
Ensure the below status's show the following:

(INSERT PICTURE)

If any of the Health Metrics show Red/Offline, reboot the radio and the 5G Hotspot. Rebooting the 5G Hotspot 
be as easy as clicking the reboot button within the remote dashboard.

Power cycling a radio can be done by disconnecting power from the radio for 30 seconds, and powering it back on.

If GPS Status within the "Location" field shows "Not Locked", ensure the Radio has a clear view of the sky, or in 
instances of Indoor Small Cell Radios, that the GPS puck has a clear view of the sky.

### Spectrum Access on the 5G Hotspot Dashboard

The Spectrum Access status will be in one of four states. It is not uncommon to see this status
change frequently.

### Spectrum Access `None` Status

A Dynamic Protection Area (DPA) is a geographic region where incumbents (Tier 1 users) get
protection from PAL and GAA interference.

During a DPA Activation event, all Small Cell Radios in the given DPA Neighborhood are disabled by
the SAS. There is nothing that you need or can do in these scenarios. The SAS will automatically
re-grant Spectrum Access once the DPA Activation event has concluded.

A message similar to the following may also be present:

> Spectrum Access status returned to "Connected" after it had been working. Wait and don't reboot.
> Suspension can last from hours to days for DPA Events. Contact support if you have been suspended
> for more than 48hrs. This is more prevalent if your location is within 150km of the DPA Regions.

### Spectrum Access `FAILURE` Status

This status is alarming, but do not let it scare you.

This "Failure" status is likely because the registration process has not been completed and
submitted to the SAS for newly installed Small Cell Radios.

You may see an information pop-up similar to this:

> SAS status code: 200 SAS response message: Response data: installationParam

Contact [FreedomFi Support](https://freedomfi.com/contact-us/) for any other warning messages.

### DPA Neighborhood Regions

DPA regions can be viewed on the map below. Remember, these coordinates are not exact, and the
affected areas for each DPA Activation event can reach as far as 150km inland.

### Small Cell Radio GPS Requirement

All compatible CBRS Small Cell Radios use GPS for network timing data and to assert the Small Cell
Radio's location when requesting approval to transmit from the FCC-regulated Spectrum Access System
(SAS).

Small Cell Radios will need to be placed somewhere that allows the GPS antenna to be in a location
with good GPS reception (i.e., near a window). Indoor Small Cell Radios are shipped with an external
GPS antenna which can be positioned independently, while Outdoor Small Cell Radios have the GPS
antenna integrated into the body directly.
