# MOBILE Proof of Coverage

<LegacyContentBanner />

## Introduction

The Helium blockchain uses a novel work algorithm called "Proof of Coverage" ("PoC") to verify that
Hotspots are located where they claim. Put another way, PoC tries to verify, on an ongoing basis,
that Hotspots are honestly representing their location and the wireless network coverage they are
creating from that location.

While current 5G Hotspots are _also_ able to participate in the IOT Network and PoC, the CBRS Small
Cell and Wi-Fi Access Points require a new approach to validating PoC.

Modeled Coverage introduces a fundamental difference in using hexes for the MOBILE Network compared
to the IOT Network where hexes determine the locations and number of Hotspots within the given hex.
In the MOBILE Network, hexes determine where the coverage exists. Modeled Coverage data allows us to
un-tie a Radio's location from its signal strength and propagation.

:::tip One Way Traffic

A CBRS Small Cell Radio ("Radio") can only operate as a transmitter; they cannot receive incoming
data and thus can not "hear" one another directly.

Unlike CBRS, Wi-Fi Access Points have the ability to "sniff" packet data of other wireless devices
and networks to estimate where the Access Point is deployed.

LoRaWAN Hotspots utilize a PoC method that benefits from Hotspots being used as senders ("Beacon")
and receivers ("Witness") of PoC activity; read more here:

## Reward Algorithm

The proposed new algorithm for MOBILE Reward calculation in the MOBILE Rewards Oracle is as follows:

1. Supply the declared transmitter power of each Radio and its location to the Obstruction Data
   Oracle.
2. Get all hexes that have coverage from Outdoor Radios/Access Points based on the information from the
   Obstruction Data Oracle.
3. Based on the location of Indoor Radios, get all hexes with Indoor coverage and all adjacent
   hexes.
4. Use projected signal loss information from the Obstruction Data Oracle to determine the potential
   signal strength of each Outdoor Radio in each hex.
5. For each hex, get at most 3 Outdoor Radios and 3 Outdoor Wi-Fi Access Points and award the top 3
   signals based on rank, and provide a decaying multiplier, as noted in the table below. Any with a
   rank of "Fail" will receive 0 modeled coverage points, and the algorithm will end. Note, the
   calculation for this will be done in step 10.

| Rank | Hex Limit Multiplier |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| 1    | 1.00X                |
| 2    | 0.50X                |
| 3    | 0.25X                |
| Fail | 0.00X                |


- If there are more than 1 Radio/Access Point with the same signal strength level, use the
  `coverage_claim_time` value to rank the top 3 oldest installations where `coverage_claim_time`
  is the timestamp when the Radio received the spectrum access grant for the first time. The
  oldest Radio will receive the higher   rank, while the newest radio will receive the lowest rank.
  To prevent rewarding "dead" Radios,  the `coverage_claim_time` will be reset if the Radio/Access
  Point was not generating a Heartbeat for more than 72 hours and use the time of the last Heartbeat
  as the new `coverage_claim_time`.

6. Get max 1 Indoor Radios/Access Points using the same approach as above for Outdoor Radios.
7. Based on [Modeled Coverage Reward Tiers](#modeled-coverage-reward-tiers), sum up all estimated
   coverage points earned by each Radio in all hexes and multiply that by `speedtest_multiplier`, then
   the `Hex Limit Multiplier` and then any `Service Provider Boosts` for each Radio and Access Point.
   When Location-Based Optimization is added, the sum of this will be multiplied by the boost identified
   by the Oracle.
9. Divide the total number of MOBILE Rewards emitted during the Rewards Period by the sum of
   multiples of [`heartbeat_multiplier`](#heartbeat-reward-tiers),
   [`estimated_reward_points`](#modeled-coverage-reward-tiers), and
   [`speedtest_multiplier`](#speed-test-reward-tiers) for each Radio to determine MOBILE Rewards per
   `estimated_reward_point` for Radio with a passing Speed Test and valid Heartbeats.
10. Multiply the MOBILE per `estimated_reward_point` by the sum of each Radio's reward points to
   determine the MOBILE Rewards for each Radio.
   

The new formula for Reward calculation per Radio/Access Point:

$$
W = k_H \times k_S \times k_L\times k_B\times k_O \times C_E \times W_p
$$

| Variable | Description                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| $W$      | Total rewards                    |
| $k_H$    | Heartbeat multiplier             |
| $k_S$    | Speedtest multiplier             |
| $k_L$    | Hex Limit Multiplier             |
| $k_B$    | Service Provider Hex Boost       |
| $k_O$    | Final Oracle Multiplier          |
| $C_E$    | Estimated coverage points        |
| $W_p$    | Epoch rewards per coverage point |


### Calculation Example

For simplicity, assume that the total MOBILE Rewards per period is 10,000.

## Modeled Coverage

With the [passing](https://heliumvote.com/14jH67zhctwb3B5NmwiAjaXQuyF7jZMZCAnfyBYhSpRS3L22sQE) of
[HIP-74](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0074-mobile-poc-modeled-coverage-rewards.md)
Modeled Coverage aims to allow for more appropriate Rewards and incentivizes the deployment of
Radios at optimal locations.

This new algorithm uses the location of the Radio to calculate MOBILE Rewards based on the number of
res12 hexes receiving coverage from a given Radio.

The MOBILE Rewards Oracle will calculate a coverage model for each Radio by considering the physical
location, antenna direction, radio max transmit power, and Obstruction Data Oracle inputs to
calculate the number of res12 hexes receiving coverage from each Radio.

Depending on the number of res12 hexes and the resulting signal power in each, the MOBILE Rewards
Oracle will allot **Coverage Points** to a given Radio for calculating its MOBILE Rewards instead of
assuming a fixed Radio Type multiplier Reward.

### Reward Hexagon Sizing

Analysis of the coverage by a single Outdoor Radio with Modeled Coverage data shows that the res8
hex used in the IOT Network is too large to represent a Radio's coverage. Using res12 hexes better
aligns with what an Outdoor Radio can reasonably cover, with an average area of 0.0003071 kmÂ² and an
edge length of 9.4 m, slightly bigger than an average single-family home.

To summarize:

- Hexes in the MOBILE Network identify the level of coverage from all the different Radios providing
  coverage to each res12 hex.
- A Radio can provide coverage for a hex it is not located within.
- A Radio can earn Rewards by providing coverage in multiple hexes.

To help visualize the significant difference between these two resolutions, below is a map with a
green res8 hex and a purple res12 hex inside.

### Modeled Coverage Reward Tiers

:::info

Each Radio is given a **coverage points** value depending on the number and signal strength of the
res12 hexes receiving coverage from the Radio.

:::

#### Outdoor CBRS Radios

Modeled Coverage replaces Radio Type multipliers with **coverage points** represented by four tiers
of potential signal power as modeled by the Obstruction Data Oracle - `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, and
`None`.

The reward tiers for Outdoor Radios will be as follows:

|                               | Tier 1        | Tier 2                     | Tier 3                      | Tier 4           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Potential Signal Power**    | $P > -95 dBm$ | $-95 dBm \ge P > -105 dBm$ | $-105 dBm \ge P > -115 dBm$ | $P \le -115 dBm$ |
| **Potential Signal Level**    | High          | Medium                     | Low                         | None             |
| **Estimated coverage points** | 16            | 8                          | 4                           | 0                |

#### Outdoor Wi-Fi Access Points
Given the nature of 5GHz band propagation and the shared spectrum nature of the Wi-Fi standard, a similar 
table with different signal strengths is used:

|                               | Tier 1           | Tier 2                       | Tier 3                       | Tier 4             |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Potential RSSI**            | $RSSI > -65 dBm$ | $-65 dBm \ge RSSI > -75 dBm$ | $-75 dBm \ge RSSI > -85 dBm$ | $RSSI \le -85 dBm$ |
| **Potential Signal Level**    | High             | Medium                       | Low                          | None               |
| **Estimated Coverage Points** | 16               | 8                            | 4                            | 0                  |


:::note Modeled Coverage Distance Limit for Outdoor Radios

The Modeled Coverage algorithm limits the radius of coverage for a given Radio to 1000 meters. This
value results from evaluating a selection of "ideal case" Radios, which provided usable coverage to
roughly 500 meters and doubled that value. A larger radius would also be too heavy for the
computation and is a current trade-off.

:::

#### Indoor CBRS Radios

Like Outdoor, Indoor Radios can collect MOBILE Rewards by providing coverage in multiple hexes.

The Obstruction Data Oracle cannot evaluate coverage by Indoor Radios as there are no good and
reliable data sources about obstacles in indoor spaces. Instead, the Modeled Coverage Oracle uses an
approximation based on the data gathered while testing certified Indoor Radios in various indoor
settings.

From this testing, the hex in which an Indoor Radio is physically located receives maximum signal
strength coverage, and all adjacent hexes receive lower signal strength. Therefore, the algorithm
errs on generosity to ensure equitable potential MOBILE Rewards for Indoor Radio coverage.

Estimated per-hex coverage points for Indoor Radios are intentionally significantly higher than
those awarded to Outdoor Radios to balance the importance of Indoor Radios in the MOBILE Network
with their relatively smaller coverage footprints.

The reward tiers for Indoor Radios will be as follows:

|                               |   Tier 1   |       Tier 2       |
| ----------------------------- | :--------: | :----------------: |
| **Location**                  | Inside hex | All adjacent hexes |
| **Potential Signal Level**    |    High    |        Low         |
| **Estimated coverage points** |    400     |        100         |

These values were chosen by taking all the Outdoor Radios in an example area and analyzing the
resulting distribution of estimated coverage points per Radio. Estimated coverage point values were
chosen such that Indoor Radios receive roughly Â¼th the estimated coverage points as the 95th
percentile Outdoor Radios and about Â½ the points of the average Outdoor Radio.

These results align with the current Radio Type Multiplieres approach `1:2.5:4` for Indoor Radios,
Outdoor Radios, and High-Power Outdoor Radios. Figure 2 below is the cumulative distribution
function plot of the sample market Outdoor Radio estimated coverage points.

<img className="explorerSidebar" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/propagation_point_cdf.png')} />

Cumulative distribution function of Outdoor Radio estimated coverage points for 904 Radios in the
L.A. market area.

#### Indoor Wi-Fi Access Points
Similar to indoor CBRS radios, obstruction Data Oracle cannot evaluate coverage by Indoor Access
Points as there are no good and reliable data sources about obstacles in indoor spaces. Instead, 
the Modeled Coverage Oracle uses an approximation based on the data gathered while testing 
certified Indoor Radios in various indoor settings.

From this testing, Wi-Fi has a much shorter range than CBRS. Therefore, the hex in which an 
Indoor Access Point is physically located will receive maximum signal strength coverage;
however, any adjacent hexes will show a signal strength of 0.

The reward tiers for Indoor Radios will be as follows:

|                               |   Tier 1   |     
| ----------------------------- | :--------: | 
| **Location**                  | Inside hex | 
| **Potential Signal Level**    |    High    |        
| **Estimated coverage points** |    400     |        

### Modeled Coverage Explorer

:::tip check coverage

Modeled Coverage Explorer is available [here](https://planner.hellohelium.com/).

:::

Modeled Coverage data will play a key role in providing information to visualize it, with more data
added as additional external sources (e.g., [Mobile Mappers](/mobile/mobile-mappers)) come into
play.

HIP-74 proposed the creation of a new Mobile Explorer dedicated exclusively to the MOBILE Network as
adding more features and data for MOBILE Rewards to the IOT Network Explorer becomes practically
impossible as the MOBILE Network grows. The first iteration of the MOBILE Explorer proposes a basic
map overlay of 5G data coverage with signal strength.

---

### Service Provider Hex Boosting
Any Service Provider in the MOBILE subDAO can boost hexes to increase PoC rewards for certain hexes.
Boosts are temporary, and to keep hexes boosted, a Service Provider must continuously burn some amount 
of MOBILE into the hex. Multiple Service Providers can burn MOBILE into the same hex for cumulative 
effect. Res12 hex resolution is currently used for boosting to stay consistent with HIP74. The minimum 
boost time commitment is six months. Service Providers can extend boost in 1-month increments, following 
6-month expiration by burning additional MOBILE into the hexes. Once a Service Provider burns MOBILE into 
a hex, it remains âboostedâ indefinitely until some coverage is created in the hex location. Creation of
coverage will be considered to have been confirmed when at least three unique phones with discovery 
mapping enabled have successfully connected and passed at least 1MB of data at the location of coverage 
(as evidenced by the Mobile Oracle)

---

### Overlapping Hex Limits (Implemented)
To prevent deployers from facing their deployments in the same direction to obtain maximum coverage points,
overlapping hex limits were introduced to ensure that only the best setups are rewarded, with only the top
three (3) ranked radio signals in each res12 hex being awarded modeled coverage points. Any radios not
ranked within the top three (3) will be ranked as âFailâ, and receive no modeled coverage points 
for that res12 hex. The strongest signal strength of Wi-Fi and CBRS within each res12 hex will be awarded
a multiplier of `1`. The second strongest strength will be awarded a multiplier of `0.50`, while the third 
being awarded `0.25`. Any other signals not ranked within the top 3 will not receive any modeled coverage
points.

| Rank | Multiplier |
| ---- | ---------- |
| 1    | 1.00X      |
| 2    | 0.50X      |
| 3    | 0.25X      |
| Fail | 0.00X      |


In instances where there is a tie in the signal strength, `Coverage Claim Time`  will be used use to rank the 
Radios/Access Points that have the same signal strength, where `coverage_claim_time` is the timestamp when 
the Radio received the spectrum access grant for the first time, and the Access Point received its first 
Heart Beat. The oldest Radio/Access Point will receive the higher rank, while the newest Radio/Access Point will 
receive the lowest rank. To prevent rewarding "dead" Radios/Access Points, `coverage_claim_time` is reset if 
the Radio/Access Point is not generating a Heartbeat for more than 72 hours and use the time of the last 
Heartbeat as the new `coverage_claim_time`.

---

### Location-Based Optimization 

The passing of [HIP 103](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0103-oracle-hex-boosting.md) allows for the
creation of Oracles to boost or reduce PoC rewards based on the location they are deployed in. Most notably,
the Footfall Oracle will identify areas that have a high level of footfall traffic to determine which areas
should have a higher or lower boost based on the footfall data. This is currently being implemented, with
an expected implementation date of Q2 2024.

---

## Uptime Heartbeats

A "heartbeat" is data sent by the 5G Hotspot indicating that a connected Radio is authorized to
transmit 5G coverage.

Heartbeats occur every 60 seconds and transmit authorizations are valid for 240 seconds. This
rolling overlap ensures that a Small Cell Radio can broadcast on an ongoing basis while allowing for
brief interruptions.

To encourage reliable signal availability, 5G Hotspots and connected CBRS Small Cell Radios must
generate at least one valid heartbeat per hour in 12 unique hours of the 24-hour Reward Period.

### Heartbeat Reward Tiers

:::info Heartbeat impact on Radio rewards

Each Radio is given a **heartbeat multiplier** of either `0` or `1`.

:::

Each Radio is awarded 1 point for a valid heartbeat in each hour, with a maximum of 24 points in the
Reward Period. All Radios with at least 12 points in the 24-hour Reward Period are given a
`heartbeat multiplier` of `1` and will be eligible to earn MOBILE Rewards.

## Backhaul Speed Tests {#backhaul-speed-tests}

A 5G Hotspot automatically performs Speed Tests, with the results averaged by the MOBILE PoC Oracle.
The MOBILE PoC Oracle includes these Speed Test metrics in the Rewards calculations for each 5G
Hotspot.

The 5G Hotspot will randomly measure download, upload, and latency to the MOBILE verifier twice in a
given 24-hour period. If a test can not complete successfully, the 5G Hotspot automatically retries
every 30 minutes until a Speed Test is successful. The first Speed Test for a newly installed 5G
Hotspot is performed within the first 12 hours after powering it on.

A minimum of two and maximum of six Speed Tests are required in the previous 48 hours to calculate a
Moving average results for each download, upload, and latency, after which a new series of Speed
Test results must be collected before a Moving Average can be calculated.

### Speed Test Reward Tiers

:::info Speed test impact on Radio rewards

Each 5G Hotspot is given a `speedtest multiplier` of either `0.0`, `0.25`, `0.5` or `1.0`.

This multiplier is applied to all connected Radios in rewards calculations.

:::

Many locations where CBRS connectivity is being deployed, including some rural areas, do not always
have the high-speed Internet connectivity needed to meet the acceptable Internet requirements for
Genesis rewards consistently.

Often these areas do not have good cellular coverage either. That's why we believe it is essential
to incentivize Helium deployments in less well-connected areas.

In response to community feedback and further exploration by Chris from DeWiPulse for his
[analysis of and commentary on public Internet data in the United States,](https://dewipulse.com/connectivity-where-it-matters/)
Speed Test results are categorized into one of four Tiers - `Good`, `Acceptable`, `Degraded`, `Poor`, and
`Fail`.


| Speed Test Tier | Speedtest Multiplier | Requirement (speeds in Mbps, latency in ms)    |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Good            | 1.00X                | 100+ Download, AND 10+ Upload, AND <50 Latency |
| Acceptable      | 0.75X                | 75+ Download, AND 8+ Upload, AND <60 Latency   |
| Degraded        | 0.50X                | 50+ Download, AND 5+ Upload, AND <75 Latency   |
| Poor            | 0.25X                | 30+ Download, AND 2+ Upload, AND <100 Latency  |
| Fail            | 0.00X                | <30 Download, OR <2 Upload, OR >100 Latency    |

Tiered Speed Test values are used as a multiplier in Rewards calculations as follows:

- Speed Test Results are put into Tiers based on the minimum value of each Download, Upload, and
  Latency (logical `AND`).
- Speed Test results that do not meet the minimum requirements for any Download, Upload, or Latency
  are considered to have `Failed` and are not eligible for Rewards until the Speed Test Average is
  improved (logical `OR`).

:::tip Requirements Will Evolve

As the needs and realities of the Network change, backhaul requirements will evolve to better suit
the Network and its users.

### Speed Test Example Calculations

Here are a set of tables to help visualize the components that make up the Speed Test result.

:::info

It may take up to 12 hours for newly connected 5G Hotspots to perform a Speed Test, and a minimum of
2 Speed Tests are required for the MOBILE PoC Oracle to calculate a moving average.

:::

<Tabs block={true}>

<TabItem value="successful speed test" label="â Successful Speed Test" default>

This 5G Hotspot is passing all Speed Test metrics and is providing a high-quality connection.

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/speed-test-success.png')} />

**Test 1**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Test 1 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 2 and Later**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of these are the most recent.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="failing a speed test" label="â Failing A Speed Test" default>

This 5G Hotspot has failed its Speed Test on all metrics in Test 6, but the Moving Average stays
within the passing range.

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/speed-test-one-fail.png')} />

**Test 1**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Test 1 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 2 and Later**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 2 and later are the most recent.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="missing a single speed test" label="â Missing A Single Speed Test" default>

This 5G Hotspot has not reported Speed Test data at Test 5.

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/speed-test-one-miss.png')} />

**Test 1**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Test 1 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 2 through 4**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 2 through 4 are the most recent.

**Test 5 through 6**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Tests 5 through 6 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 7 and Later**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 7 and later are the most recent.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="multiple sub-optimal speed tes" label="â Multiple Sub-Optimal Speed Tests" default>

This 5G Hotspot has less than `Acceptable` Speed Tests in Tests 3, 4, 5, and 6. This has caused the
Moving Average to fall for Tests 6, 7, and 8.

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/speed-test-many-fail.png')} />

**Test 1**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Test 1 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 2 through 5**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 2 through 5 are the most recent.

**Test 6 through 8**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **half** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 6 through 8 are the most recent as at least one Speed Test metric Moving Average
has not met or exceeded the required values.

**Test 9 and Later**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 9 and later are the most recent.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="missing multiple speed tests" label="ð Missing Multiple Speed Tests" default>

This 5G Hotspot has not reported Speed Test data during Test 5, 6, or 7. This is often a result of a
5G Hotspot being disconnected from the Internet for a long time.

<img className="docsheader" src={useBaseUrl('img/5g-on-helium/speed-test-many-miss.png')} />

**Test 1**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Test 1 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 2 through 4**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
results of Tests 2 through 4 are the most recent.

**Test 5 through 8**

This 5G Hotspot **will not** be eligible for rewards during the Reward Periods for which the results
of Tests 5 through 8 are the most recent as there is not enough data to calculate a Moving Average.

**Test 9 and Later**

This 5G Hotspot **will** be eligible for **full** rewards during the Reward Periods for which the
